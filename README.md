## 💡 Inspiration

The scenario of gaming nowadays is more likely to be addictive. The purpose of gaming is to rewind and to spend some leisure time enjoyably. The game we created is to spend our free time playing games that aren't addictive and hence it inspired us. The game is a perfect combination of logical thinking via riddles and the fun of gaming.

## 💻 What it does

Pirates of the storm is a free web fun game. In the game, the player needs to release their soul and find the way out of the game. The game is divided into two plotlines. The first: **Find the Soul** is the main plot where the player finds pieces of their soul by solving riddles in an interactive 3D Model of a Pirate Ship which can be viewed in Augmented Reality. The second: **Soul Breaker** is the plot where the players fight the Soul Breaker to find the key to release their souls. Key found can then be used to redeem your soul and set the curse free.
